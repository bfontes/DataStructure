# Algorithms and Data Structure 
Repository focused on the activities of the discipline of algorithms and data structures ll of the UFRN computer engineering course.

## Project description 
The object proposed here is to solve three common challenges of code interviews for programmers, these questions involve subjects such as: linkedlist, queues and stacks, which are extremely important to develop good logic.
We were encouraged to use the ChatGPT tool to help us solve the challenges and to support the learning journey.
To ensure that the functions were developed correctly, we use tests to validate the applied logic.

## Here's the link that explained the challenge on Loom: https://www.loom.com/share/03bd5b6f2d2541a4a3e73577fe531548
