# Algorithms and Data Structure 
Repository focused on the activities of the discipline of algorithms and data structures ll of the UFRN computer engineering course.

### Lessons
**Week 03** - Linkedlist, Queques, Stacks
- **Project description**: The object proposed here is to solve three common challenges of code interviews for programmers, these questions involve subjects such as: linkedlist, queues and stacks, which are extremely important to develop good logic.
We were encouraged to use the ChatGPT tool to help us solve the challenges and to support the learning journey.
To ensure that the functions were developed correctly, we use tests to validate the applied logic.

**Week 04** - Recursion, Binary tree and Search tree
- **Project description**: The object proposed here is to solve two common challenges of code interviews for programmers, like Fibonacci and now involving recursive problems.
We were encouraged to use the ChatGPT tool to help us solve the challenges and to support the learning journey.
To ensure that the functions were developed correctly, we use tests to validate the applied logic.

**Week 10** - Small words(analysis about the fligthts in Brazil)
- **Project description**: Este trabalho tem por objetivo usar dos assuntos estudados como assortatividade, análise bivariada, componentes conectados e coeficiente de clusteriazação para fazer uma análise das conexões entre os voos no Brazil. Neste sentido, realizamos as 5 questões propostas da atividade, com a colaboração de [Vilson Rodrigues](https://github.com/Vilsonrodrigues) e dados de [Alvaro](https://github.com/alvarofpp/dataset-flights-brazil).

**Assortativity**
